# Handwriting Recognition

Using machine learning to recognize a 28x28 grayscale handwritten image and identify it as a digit between 0 and 9 using four classifiers, namely Logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, Random forest and SVM. The classifiers are trained on MNIST training dataset and tested using MNIST test set and USPS dataset. The results from all the classifiers are ensembled to get a final decision.
